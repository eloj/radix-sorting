# Notes on Radix Sorting and Implementation

_TODO: These notes (and code) are incomplete. My goal is to eventually provide a step-by-step
guide and introduction to a very simple radix sort implementation, and try to cover
the basic issues which are sometimes glossed over in text books and courses_

These are my notes on engineering a [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort).

The ideas behind radix sorting are not new in any way, but seems to have become,
if not forgotten, so at least under-utilized, as over the years _quicksort_ became
the go-to "default" sorting algorithm.

This code can sort 40 million 32-bit integers in under half a second using a single
core of an [Intel i5-3570T](https://ark.intel.com/products/65521/Intel-Core-i5-3570T-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_30-GHz), a low-TDP CPU from 2012
using DDR3-1333.

## Background

_TODO_

## From the top; Counting sort

The simplest way to sort an array of integers, without comparisons, is to simply count
how many there are of each unique integer, and use those counts to write the result.

This is the most basic [counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort).

```c
void counting_sort_8(uint8_t *arr, size_t n)
{
	size_t cnt[256] = { 0 };
	size_t i;

	// Count number of occurences of each octet.
	for (i = 0 ; i < n ; ++i) {
		cnt[arr[i]]++;
	}

	// Write cnt_a a's to the array in order.
	i = 0;
	for (size_t a = 0 ; a < 256 ; ++a) {
		while (cnt[a]--)
			arr[i++] = a;
	}
}
```

You could easily extend this code to work with 16-bit values, but if you try to push much further the drawbacks
of a _general_ counting sort become fairly obvious; you need a location (_bucket_) to store the count for each unique
integer. For 8- and 16-bit numbers this would amount to `2^8*4`=1KiB and `2^16*4`=256KiB of memory. For
32-bit integers, it'd require `2^32*4`=16GiB of memory.

## Step two; Histogram sort

_TODO_

## All together now; Radix sort

_TODO_

## TODO

* Very suspectible to compiler optimization (check << 3 vs * 8 again), GCC7.3 vs GCC5...
* Not going over asymptotics, but mention latency. Hybrid sorting.
